# card-games

A collection of card games made to practice the basics.  I did not refer to any outside material when programming these as I wanted to arrive at solutions based on my own understanding.  Later I plan on going back and improving the code either after learning more on my own or researching  examples of better practices.

"card_deck.py" Includes a list of handy functions which handle deck creation, shuffling, dealing a card, dealing players their hand, value and suit identification, and comparison based on either value or suit.
